BookMyShow Project with GUVI

As part of my upskilling journey with GUVI, I successfully completed a project replicating key functionalities of BookMyShow. This hands-on project involved designing and developing a movie booking web application, where users can explore movie listings, check showtimes, book tickets, and manage their bookings.

Key Highlights:
Frontend Development: Used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build responsive, user-friendly interfaces.
Backend Integration: Implemented server-side logic for ticket booking, user authentication, and data handling with Node.js and Express.js.
Database Management: Set up and managed MongoDB for storing movie listings, user data, and booking information.
API Integration: Worked with third-party APIs to fetch real-time movie details and available showtimes.
